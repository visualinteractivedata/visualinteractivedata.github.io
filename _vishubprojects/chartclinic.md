The VisHub group offers a monthly **Chart Clinic** to researchers and students at the University of Edinburgh. On the **last Friday of every month**, one or more [members of our group](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io/people.html) will be available **on Teams from 3-4pm (UK time)** to give advice on your charts and visualisations (for your websites, papers, posters, presentations, etc.).

No sign-up required, just drop in, bring your visualisation and questions. We'll try our best to help you (re)design your visualisation and can help to brainstorm solutions. We will not be able to design or implement a visualisation for you. We are also around for general questions about visualisation design, tools, methods, theory, etc. Note that the field is growing very quickly—we will try our best to help you navigate the jungle.

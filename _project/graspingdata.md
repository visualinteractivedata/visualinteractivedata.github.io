The project works with 270 children (aged 3-8) in schools, in partnership with SSERC, Edinburgh Zoo and Glasgow Science Centre to construct physical representations of personal data that children can touch, explore, talk about and learn with. It aims to contribute knowledge to early learning, cognitive psychology, child-centred design, data ethics, data visualization and computer science.Â 

As a result, children will have a better understanding and value of their personal data, and greater confidence that they should and can play a role in the design of their future.

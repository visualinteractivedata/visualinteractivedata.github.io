## Project

The project aims to develop visualizations, interfaces and systems to support analysts in the humanities (history, social science, archaeology, etc.) in exploring geo-temporal networks. Our research aims to provide new ways to support interactive exploration for network data as well as training novice-analysts in data and visualization literacy. A research engineer role will support the development of our network visualization platform. Publications are aimed to be presented at top-tier international conferences (CHI, VIS, EuroVis).

The project is led by [Benjamin Bach](http://benjbach.me). We will collaborate with researchers in visualization and HCI at Microsoft Research as well as in network analysis, archeology, and history in the UK, across Europe, and beyond. 

## Environment

Both positions are hosted by the [VisHub](https://visualinteractivedata.github.io) group at the University of Edinburgh. The group is a new and thriving interdisciplinary visualization group including faculty, postdocs, PhD students, and master students in Design Informatics. We focus on topics in visualization and HCI such as visualization of networks and temporal data, storytelling, visualization education, physicalization, peace analytics, and immersive analytics. We engage in collaborations in public health, NLP, international law, history, social sciences, industry and visualization researchers across the globe. The Vishub is embedded within the School of Informatics as well as the Institute for Design Informatics spanning both Informatics and the School of Design. The successful candidate for the postdoc position are invited to both PhD and MSc/MA supervision as well as teaching (extra pay).

The School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh offers many possiblities for interdiscipliny collaborations. Edinburgh is a beautiful, international, and academic place amidst the Scottish nature and close to islands and Highlands. 

The PI will help the postdoc and research engineer with career planning, networking, and teaching relevant research skills relevant to the project and beyond (methodolgy, proposal writing, etc.).

# Considering a PhD at the VisHub Lab

  If you consider a PhD at the VisHub, please carefully read the following information and get in touch with one of the possible [faculty](https://vishub.net/people).
  
  
## Topic

We always have a list of topics. Either these are open topics related to our [research](https://vishub.net/index#projects) or these are [funded projects](https://vishub.net/jobs/index.html). In any case, get in touch with a potential superisor early in the process to discuss your ideas and directions. It may turn out that the topic is not really fitting our expertise and we are not able to help you.

To come up with a topic, we advise you to 
* study our [research](https://vishub.net/index#projects) and [publications](https://vishub.net/publications). 
* read a lot!
* try to define a small yet tangible project that we can start with and that helps exploring the bigger picture. For example, if you are intereated in data physicalizations, try to define and illustrate a small problem you see and that you can study in, e.g., 6 months time.
 

## Planning

Start the process of planning for a PhD as early as possible. For example, if you are a Design Informtics students, get in touch with us early in the program if you are thinking about a PhD. We can help you with possible [internships](https://vishub.net/jobs/index.html) for a variety of reasons: 
* you will gain experience in research methodology and data visualization, 
* you will explore if you are fit for research and want to work in reserch, 
* it will help us better know you, 
* we will have the opportunity to develop a topic (which can take a lot of time and reading). 
* (**most important**) we would try publish your work to give you a publication which will help you with your [PhD application](https://vishub.net/jobs/index.html)

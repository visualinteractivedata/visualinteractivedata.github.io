## You can [download the document here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_M2TbCDCF_qQ8vvazNM8KLerr30uTiL0/view?usp=sharing), as well as my [full CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V34l5E9IV3wHo-w2x0EcfN0MCSCnHrdICZ0KQdD5gnA/edit?tab=t.0). 

This thesis presents novel forms and tools to communicating data and creating visualizations. With the proliferation of data-driven practices, data visualizations are essential for the analysis of data as well as the communication to diverse stakeholders. Yet, the design of visualization and communication of data are made challenging by the complexity of the real-world phenomena represented by the data, the datasets themselves, and the expertise of the analysts and communicators. Hence, in this thesis, I seek answers to the question _How to make people understand complex phenomena through data?_ and summarize some of my research addressing three respective key challenges within this context: 
(i) the creation and study of __forms for data-driven storytelling and communication__ (data comics, dashboards, visualization atlases, visualization articles, dataGIFs);
(ii) the __design and implementation of tools to design, create and use visualization__ (authoring interactive data comics, semi-automatic data tours, a network visualization grammar); 
and (iii) the __education in skills__ related to visualization literacy and design (challenges experienced in exploring networks, challenges in visualization education, automatic explanation of visual patterns). 
I conclude with a discussion of future research directions around novel forms of storytelling, visualization authoring and design, and visualization education. 


# What is an Habilitation (HDR)?
In France, the _Habilitation À Diriger des Recherches (HDR)_ is a step in the career of academic researchers – assistant professors at universities and research scientists at public institutes like Inria. The HDR is not mandatory but the vast majority of researchers end up applying for it and getting it. The HDR allows researchers to supervise PhD students independently and to have a higher limit on the number of students they can supervise.

Some liken the HDR to academic tenure (US) but the HDR does not change anything in terms of job title, job security (which is already guaranteed to those who apply), or salary. The HDR is required to apply for higher-ranking positions like Full Professor and Research Director. Personally, I had been thorugh a similar process at the University of Edinburgh in 2022, but Inria did not see this as an equivalent, unfortunately. 

The HDR process is __modeled after the PhD process, but it is lighter__: many consider it a formality. The candidate first requests the authorization to apply for an HDR from their institution, who grants the request if their CV shows enough experience (having co-advised a single PhD student is often sufficient). The candidate then __writes a thesis (the HDR manuscript) that summarizes their past research or a subset__ of it. This manuscript is then read by three external reviewers who write a report. If the three reports authorize the defense, the candidate defends in front of a jury who asks questions. The jury then writes a short defense report and – unless there is a very serious problem – grants the HDR.

# What will be expected from you
An HDR jury has various people with different roles. If you read this, you are probably a rapporteur.


### Rapporteurs (manuscript reviewers)
There needs to be three rapporteurs, two of whom with an HDR or equivalent (full professors outside France qualify). About two months before the defense, each rapporteur receives the HDR manuscript (generally 50–80 pages without references) and is expected to __read the manuscript__, __read the applicant's CV__, and __write a ~two-page report__ (many reports are between 1.5 pages and 3 pages). The report summarizes the manuscript with some high-level comments, briefly comments on the CV, and __concludes that there is enough to defend__. [Here is an archetypal HDR report](https://dragice.fr/Archetypal_HDR_report.pdf). Variations around this format are allowed, the important part being the __final sentence that recommends the defense__. Also make sure you include the __letterhead of your institution and you sign__. Rapporteurs have about one month to send their report after having received the manuscript (in your case, you have a more time). Rapporteurs are also expected to __attend the defense virtually or physically__ to act as examinateurs, which includes __asking questions__, deliberating and __helping write the final defense report__. See below for more info.

### Examinateurs (defense reviewers)
Examinateurs quickly read the manuscript if they haven't done so as rapporteurs, attend the defense (virtually or physically), ask questions, and right after the defense, they meet the other jury members to write the defense report (which is typically short) and issue a final decision. The entire process __lasts up to 3 hours__.

On top of the work described so far, be prepared to do a little bit of administrative work with the University, like filling some forms.

### Other members
There are other roles like the President of the jury but those are usually fulfilled by French people who know the process so I won't cover them here.

# Timeline 

1. Ben sends you the thesis document through email: **early September**
2. Rapporteurs send their rapports to the University: **early November** (at least one month after receiving the thesis document. You have about 2 months time)
3. Planned defense: **mid December**. 

# Questions?
Please ask me if you have any question. As we progress through the administrative process, you will be put in touch with administrative assistants to whom you will also be able to ask questions.

The structure overseeing the HDR process is the [École Doctorale Mathématiques et Informatique de l'Université de Bordeaux](https://ed-mi.u-bordeaux.fr). Should you have any worry about the process, feel free to email Guillaume Blin (guillaume.blin@u-bordeaux.fr), the chair of the École Doctorale. For administrative questions, email Emma Berthault <emma.berthault@u-bordeaux.fr>.
